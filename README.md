# AI-Scheduling

This was my senior design project at UTD. My team and I were tasked with creating a program to create a schedule for an orchestra summer camp. We broke up this team into three groups: the front-end, data pipeline, and AI.

I was in the AI group and my teammate and I utilized Google OR-Tools and constraint programming. Our considerations included the student's ages, their skill level, their instructer preferences, instruementation, and more. To run this program you will need to install Google OR-Tools.
